While I'm still six months out from graduating I've made a lot of mistakes along the way and there are many things I would change the way I did them, but that's life eh?
Some things you have to learn for yourself but I hope I can help new developers learn from my mistakes.

### Comparing Myself to others

When I first started my degree I often compared myself to others wondering why I didn't understand something as fast as they did, or that I'm not as competent as my lecturers think I am and I fluked my grades. This caused a lot of anxiety for me in my first year, especially as I was a "mature" student so my peers were all 10 years younger than me. I still compare myself to others, its a hard habit to break, but I've learnt that everyone learns at their own pace, in their own way and what someone else may excel in doesn't mean you aren't intelligent in other areas.

### Taking Initiative to Learn Something

Tertiary education is constantly changing its curriculum to best help its students become employable in the current times. It doesn't help the IT is a constantly changing/ upgrading area to work in. My introduction to javascript was very minimal in the first year, and then non-existent in the second year. By the time I got to the third year, my knowledge was a miss mash of pure javascript mixed with jQuery. This is still a struggle for me, but now when I start a project I choose one or the other no matter what hurdles I face. It helps me get that knowledge and understanding I have been missing. A free resource that I like to use is [FreeCodeCamp.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

### Start an Independant Project 
This is a big one I regret, not starting a project that I would work on in my own time. This is a big one for prospective employers, they want to know that you can take initiative. I felt like I had no time for a project with working part-time and studying full time I didn't want to work in the spare time I had. But even if you just start something, like setting up the framework for an idea, that's better than nothing. Also, you don't have to think of elaborate, never-been-done-before, ideas; just something that your not doing in your job/school. 

 Let me know what lessons you would pass on to beginners in the comments :)
