I've always believed in working smarter not harder. 

Especially when it comes to programming. Their are multitudes of languages, frameworks, ides etc. out there that no one can truly remember or retain knowledge of it all. I'm the first to admit I am not confident in my own programming abilities, which is why I set myself small tasks in languages I think would help. Here are my top 5 helpful things for those just starting web development or any type of programming really.



### Learn How to Google

This may seem like a silly one however being able to research and ask the right questions to find the solution to your problem is such a great skill to have. Using keywords like the framework or language your using is a start, then narrow it down but using error codes or console messages in your browser. Sometimes it will take a bit of tweaking to get the keywords or the right site links.  

Here are some examples I have used:

![example search history](assets/examplesearchhistory.png "example search history")

![example search history 2](assets/examplesearchhistory2.png "example search history 2")

![example search history 3](assets/examplesearchhistory1.png "example search history 3")

In the third image I have used the error from my browser console "Cannot query field "publicUrl" on type "File" "  and added the framework gatsby to the end so it narrows my search and will show me mostly wed development site links.
