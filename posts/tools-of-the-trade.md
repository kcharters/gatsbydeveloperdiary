PlayStation or Xbox? Samsung or Apple? Tea or Coffee? Everyone has their preferences on what operating system, software or drink they like and developing is the same. You will find a myriad of articles and blog posts on specific software and products being the 'best', but I believe it is also about familiarity and comfort for the developer. What works for one person may not work for another, so here are the main development tools I use, why I like them and some alternatives. 

<em> I use windows so all these tools will work with windows, links to macOS versions or macOS alternatives will be avaliable </em>
<em> I am also only a junior/budding web developer so please dont take anything as scripture</em>

## Code Editor
### Visual Studio Code

Not to be confused with Visual Studio, Visual studio code is a free code editor from Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. VSCode Intellisense helps with syntax highlighting and smart completions, Install extensions to add new languages, themes, debuggers and Source control your projects with built-in git to review changes, stage files and make commits without using gitbash command line (though if you prefer to use a command like VScode has an integrated terminal). User Interface is simple and sleek, with action displays when hovering over certain buttons.

Intellisense syntax highlighting and the abundance of extensions helped me with my projects, especially when learning a new language's syntax every semester.

Download VScode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or even if you're just starting on HTML notepad will work just fine.

## Source Contro
### Git/Github

Github is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration using Git. Work on your projects or with others making use of their collaborative features like Issues for tickets, Projects to create sprints and kanban boards, code review pull requests before merging new code to a project. Github has free and paid accounts (I suggest if you are a freelance web developer or starting to get a free account). I like cloud-based hosting, I can access my work from any computer no matter where I am and as someone who has lost a hard drive of work, I feel safe knowing my work is still available. 

Create your free Github account [here](https://github.com/), download git for Windows, macOS or Linux [here](https://git-scm.com/download) and if you're more into DevOps than software development, git had [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) as an option.

## Package Manager 
### Npm (Node Package Manager)

Package managers are programs that are used to install, uninstall and manage software packages. The main contenders for package managers are NPM and Yarn, Npm has the largest community and is very reliable, and since 2019 its performance has improved to match those of the newer package managers. As I developed in node.js first I became comfortable using npm over yarn. There are various package managers are depending on your operating system, Linux or OSX users will be familiar with the apt install (advanced package tool) or brew install (homebrew) commands.

## API Tools
### Postman

Ever browsed the web and gotten a 404 error? perhaps a 500 error? That's an API (application programming interface ) request that has failed or doesn't exist. When you head to Facebook your browser is making an API GET request to Facebooks server, once your browser gets a response it displays the page. This is the simplest way I can think of explaining an HTTP request. I haven't used many other API tools apart from Postman, and it had a bit of a learning curve. The purpose of this is to test that your APIs request is working and return the correct data (but be careful, Postman has its workaround for deployment so and API that works in postman may not work on your localhost site until you deploy it. yes I got caught out on that one). 

It's [free](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and available in Linux and macOS as well (just look for the small text) another option I have yet to try but seems to be a contender against Postman is [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) (also has macOS and Linux versions)

## Other tools 

Alongside all of these tools, I also prefer to use Anaconda prompt for my command line. This is a purely personal preference, due to starting new projects in frameworks and having to use the arrow keys to choose from preset choices. Gitbash or command prompt made this difficult and seeing as I already had Anaconda navigator installed from data science papers, I just prefer to use [anaconda prompt](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/install/). 
Also, I will never go back to using a single screen. Have multiple screens has made working so much easier, especially when you have one program for coding, one for testing, one for previewing and I don't know how many prompt screens I end up with but I refuse to work on a single monitor now.

what are the tools you like to use?
